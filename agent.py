             "- Inner circles may contain target points or scoring zones "
             "- Players position themselves around the circle when playing "
             "- Marbles are the most common game pieces, though bottle caps can be used too "
             "- The objective involves aiming and shooting marbles at targets or other marbles "
             "- Movement paths and trajectories are important for strategic play "
             "- Players take turns throwing their marbles from outside the circle toward the center\n\n"
